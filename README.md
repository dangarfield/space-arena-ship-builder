### Contribute:
- https://space-arena-ship-builder.now.sh/ (or index.html in this repo)
- Any basic local web-server is good. I typically use node.js with `npm install -g serve`, with `npm start` to run locally
- On [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceArena/comments/9xques/online_ship_builder_app/)

### TODO:
- Style the main div in centre correctly - Styling is not my forte
- Drag and select rather than click
- ~~Save and import from string - Read row and col content data-type attributes as nested array. Create modal for saving and inputting~~ Complete
- ~~Resizing grid doesn't remove grid state~~ Complete
